# Getting and Cleaning Data - Project
Repository for Getting and Cleaning Data course final project on Coursera

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with,
and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for
later analysis.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable
computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop
the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the
course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the
Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where
the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

## `run_analysis.R` script

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each
measurement
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5. Create an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for
each activity and each subject

## Review Criteria
1. The submitted data set is tidy.
2. The repo contains the required scripts.
3. The repo contains a code book that modifies and updates the available
codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated,
along with units, and any other relevant information.
4. The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
5. The work submitted for this project is original work.

## Submission
The following items will be submitted:
1. A tidy data set
2. A link to a Github repository with a script for performing the analysis
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations 
or work performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
4. A README.md that explains how all of the scripts work and how they are 
connected
